# FLUIDOS CoreNet

**Tagline:** Secure, Decentralized Node Services with Privacy by Design

## Overview

FLUIDOS CoreNet showcases secure resource sharing across edge and cloud environments. It integrates the FLUIDOS Node with the Privacy and Security Manager (PSM), REAR Security components, and the OpenCall XADATU use case.

This playground demonstrates advanced access control using:

- Decentralized Identity (DID)
- Attribute-Based Authorization
- Blockchain-Based Logging

These mechanisms ensure secure, verifiable operations in a distributed ecosystem. It also supports confidential computing via secure enclaves.
